This repository contains the code I have written for my Final Year Project (FYP) in university.

For this project, I created a virtual library web application, using .NET Core and Entity Framework Core. This library allowed users to access digital books online. The technical area of this project was incorporating a security measure to protect these books and prevent them from being copied, downloaded, or accessed without permission. For this I used Digital Rights Management (DRM) as a form of digital content protection on the book PDF files in the system. I successfully created my own DRM system using tools such as 'Syncfusion.Pdf.Net.Core' and 'Standard.Licensing', which both are packages installed from the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio 2022. This web application follows a membership program where users can only access the books if they have fulfilled their monthly membership payments, which I managed using Stripe.

My project's main objective was to create a user-friendly and secure virtual library where only authorised users could read the books.
